# Template Rules (Page Architecture Standard)

These templates eliminate structural inconsistency and repetitive page monotony.

## 1. Global Template Constraints
- Each page must instantiate one template type from this document.
- Mixed-template composition is forbidden unless explicitly documented in route metadata.
- Every template defines mandatory CTA logic, heading rules, and mobile behavior.

## 2. Marketing Landing Template

## 2.1 Section Structure (Fixed Order)
1. Hero
2. Proof strip (logos/metrics)
3. Problem-solution block
4. Feature set
5. Process/how-it-works
6. Social proof/testimonials
7. Pricing/plan framing
8. Final CTA band

### 2.2 Heading Hierarchy
- H1 in hero only.
- H2 for each major section.

### 2.4 Content Density
- Max 3 key messages in hero.
- Max 6 cards per section before introducing alternative module.

### 2.5 Mobile Adaptation
- Proof strip appears before lengthy feature grids.
- Hero CTAs stack vertically.
- Sticky mobile CTA allowed for conversion routes.

- Secondary CTA for docs/specs.

### 3.4 Content Density

## 9. Audit Problem Linkage
- **Template monotony** is resolved by fixed template families with module alternation constraints.
- **Hierarchy imbalance** is resolved by strict heading depth and section order rules.
- **CTA inconsistency** is resolved by template-specific CTA placement logic.
- **Mobile issues** are resolved via mandatory per-template collapse/stack patterns.
- **SEO scannability gaps** are resolved through required anchors, summaries, and structured modules.
